### :scroll: Brief:
Build a website using one or more API's, have loading and error states in mind.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
3 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Create a good team spirit and learning environment, get a better understanding of asynchronous functions, promises and API's, understand what Gatsby is and when to use it.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
We decided to make a webpage with an overview of our whole class based on the GitHub API. We fetched every persons public repositories and the languages used so that we could calculate a percentage of everyone's experiences. The website is first of all meant to be a resource for our class so that you know who to ask for tips when learning a new technology, but second of all also a resource for external people as a contact page. On our nice-to-have list was also a filter/search-bar and to add something indicating the experience in bytes or number of projects. We also used two smaller API's to generate the profile-pictures and to color-match the bars to that image.
